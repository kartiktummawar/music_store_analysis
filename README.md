# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the music store. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Which countries have the most Invoices?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS c, billing_country 
FROM invoice
GROUP BY billing_country
ORDER BY c DESC

```

### 2. Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals

```sql
SELECT billing_city,SUM(total) AS InvoiceTotal
FROM invoice
GROUP BY billing_city
ORDER BY InvoiceTotal DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the most money.

```sql
SELECT customer.customer_id, first_name, last_name, SUM(total) AS total_spending
FROM customer
JOIN invoice ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
GROUP BY customer.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spending DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 4. Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.

```sql
SELECT artist.artist_id, artist.name,COUNT(artist.artist_id) AS number_of_songs
FROM track
JOIN album ON album.album_id = track.album_id
JOIN artist ON artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
WHERE genre.name LIKE 'Rock'
GROUP BY artist.artist_id
ORDER BY number_of_songs DESC
LIMIT 10;

```

### 5.Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent

```sql
WITH best_selling_artist AS (
	SELECT artist.artist_id AS artist_id, artist.name AS artist_name, SUM(invoice_line.unit_price*invoice_line.quantity) AS total_sales
	FROM invoice_line
	JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
	JOIN album ON album.album_id = track.album_id
	JOIN artist ON artist.artist_id = album.artist_id
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 3 DESC
	LIMIT 1
)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, bsa.artist_name, SUM(il.unit_price*il.quantity) AS amount_spent
FROM invoice i
JOIN customer c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
JOIN invoice_line il ON il.invoice_id = i.invoice_id
JOIN track t ON t.track_id = il.track_id
JOIN album alb ON alb.album_id = t.album_id
JOIN best_selling_artist bsa ON bsa.artist_id = alb.artist_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
ORDER BY 5 DESC;

```

### 6. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres.

```sql
WITH popular_genre AS 
(
    SELECT COUNT(invoice_line.quantity) AS purchases, customer.country, genre.name, genre.genre_id, 
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY customer.country ORDER BY COUNT(invoice_line.quantity) DESC) AS RowNo 
    FROM invoice_line 
	JOIN invoice ON invoice.invoice_id = invoice_line.invoice_id
	JOIN customer ON customer.customer_id = invoice.customer_id
	JOIN track ON track.track_id = invoice_line.track_id
	JOIN genre ON genre.genre_id = track.genre_id
	GROUP BY 2,3,4
	ORDER BY 2 ASC, 1 DESC
)
SELECT * FROM popular_genre WHERE RowNo <= 1

```
